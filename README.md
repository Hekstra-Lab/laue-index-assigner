# laue-index-assigner

This package is intended to be used for the processing of Laue x-ray crystalloraphic data. It includes a number of tools that build on the DIALS framework to process raw images up through geometric refinement at this stage, with integration under development. 

The example script should be run through the `cctbx.python` supplied by your [DIALS](https://dials.github.io) installation.
The example has some extra dependencies which are available through pip and can be installed by the following command.

```bash
cctbx.python -m pip install reciprocalspaceship
```

A fuller, more detailed of dependencies and versions, along with tutorials, is to come. This software will stop after integration of reflections, at which point the next intended software of use will be [careless](https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab/careless).
