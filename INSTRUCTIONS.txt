Hi, here are the instructions for the current pipeline:

First run config.sh to set environment variables, and run setpaths.sh for your DIALS installation.

There are two pipelines right now. The first makes beams then stills, the second makes stills then beams.

PIPELINE 1 ORDER:

scan_varying_indexer.sh
dials_assign.py
assign_beams.py
multi_to_stills.py

PIPELINE 2 ORDER:

scan_varying_indexer.sh
dials_assign.py
sequence_to_stills_no_sb.py
assign_beams_to_stills.py

Please run all Python files with cctbx.python. At this point you can try refinement with diffBragg -- end of working pipeline right now.

A quick rundown of the temporary DIALS files by name and in order of generation by above scripts:

strong_1.04.refl  <-- Strong spots at lambda=1.04 angstroms
expected_index.* <-- Output of initial monochromatic dials.index at 1.04 angstroms
refined_varying.* <-- Output of scan-varying monochromatic refinement
optimized.refl <-- Output of Kevin's optimization code for Miller indices
multi.* <-- Output of script that generates multiple beam models for every image
multi_stills.* <-- Output that generates stills from multi.*; similar to dials.sequence_to_stills()
stills_no_sb.* <-- Output of script that generates stills without using shoeboxes before assigning beams
stills_no_sb_multi.* <-- Output that generates beams for stills_no_sb.* - one beam per reflection
