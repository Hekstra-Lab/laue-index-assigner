Hi, here are the instructions for the current pipeline:

First run config.sh to set environment variables, and run setpaths.sh for your DIALS installation.

Then decide whether to use dials_temp_files/pixels.mask or better_mask.mask for your analysis.

Then you can run the following scripts in this order:

scan_varying_indexer.sh
dials_assign.py
assign_beams.py
multi_to_stills.py

Please run all Python files with cctbx.python. At this point you can try refinement -- end of working pipeline right now.

A quick rundown of the temporary DIALS files by name and in order of generation by above scripts:

strong_1.04.refl  <-- Strong spots at lambda=1.04 angstroms
expected_index.* <-- Output of initial monochromatic dials.index at 1.04 angstroms
refined_varying.* <-- Output of scan-varying monochromatic refinement
optimized.refl <-- Output of Kevin's optimization code for Miller indices
multi.* <-- Output of script that generates multiple beam models for every image
multi_stills.* <-- Output that generates stills from multi.*; similar to dials.sequence_to_stills()
