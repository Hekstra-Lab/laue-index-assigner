Hi, here are the instructions for the current pipeline:

First run config.sh to set environment variables, and run setpaths.sh for your DIALS installation.

PIPELINE 2 ORDER:

scan_varying_indexer.sh
sequence_to_stills_no_sb.py
dials_assign.py
assign_beams_to_stills.py

Please run all Python files with cctbx.python. At this point you can try refinement with diffBragg -- end of working pipeline right now.

A quick rundown of the temporary DIALS files by name and in order of generation by above scripts:

strong_1.04.refl  <-- Strong spots at lambda=1.04 angstroms
expected_index.* <-- Output of initial monochromatic dials.index at 1.04 angstroms
refined_varying.* <-- Output of scan-varying monochromatic refinement
optimized.* <-- Output of Kevin's optimization code for Miller indices
stills_no_sb.* <-- Output of script that generates stills without using shoeboxes before assigning beams
stills_no_sb_multi.* <-- Output that generates beams for stills_no_sb.* - one beam per reflection
